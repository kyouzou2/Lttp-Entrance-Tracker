# Lttp-Entrance-Tracker
An LttP Entrance Tracker created by Kyou

This is a tracker created for use with LttP Entrance Randomizers. This is a simplistic design intended for keeping track of where a player has been, and not where they can go.

INSTRUCTIONS
----------------
1. Open ENTTracker.html. This should reveal the LttP world map with green dots on it. Each circle is placed on an entrance in LttP (Ganon's Tower not included)
2. Click a circle to change its color. Green, to white, to yellow, to red.

SUGGESTIONS
----------------
1. Green means that an entrance has not been checked.
2. White means that an entrance has been checked and can be ignored.
3. Yellow and red are up to the player. Personally, I use red for dungeons and yellow for places I might return to later.
